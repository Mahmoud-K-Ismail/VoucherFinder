### 2. **Show the Homepage** (30 seconds)
- Point out the clean, modern UI
- Highlight the three value props:
  - ‚úì Credits Creators

2. Click "Find Codes" button
3. Watch loading animation

**Point out AI Suggestions (appears first):**
- "üí° AI Suggestion: Smart Ways to Save"
- Show first suggestion:
  - "New Account Free Trial - Get 30 days free"
  - "Estimated savings: $14.99"
  - "‚úì Verified by 847 users this month"

## üé™ Key Features to Highlight

### ‚úÖ Technical Highlights
1. **Multi-source scraping**: YouTube API + BeautifulSoup for coupon sites
2. **AI integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 for smart suggestions
3. **Modern stack**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Flask
4. **Real-time verification**: Community-powered confidence scores

### ‚úÖ Business Highlights
1. **Ethical**: Credits YouTubers and creators (unlike Honey)
2. **Comprehensive**: Codes + AI suggestions (2 value props in 1)
3. **Scalable**: Easy to add more sources (Reddit, Twitter, etc.)
4. **Monetizable**: Clear revenue streams

## üí° Talking Points

### Why YouTube?
"YouTube creators share exclusive discount codes in video descriptions, but nobody scrapes them systematically. We do."

### Why AI Suggestions?
"A 20% off code is good, but knowing you can get a free trial + student discount is better. AI helps users think outside the 'coupon code' box."

### Why Ethical?
"Honey was exposed for not crediting creators. We show exactly who shared each code and link back to them."

### Why Better Than Competitors?
| Feature | Honey | RetailMeNot | VoucherFinder |
|---------|-------|-------------|---------------|
| YouTube scraping | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| AI suggestions | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Creator credit | ‚ùå | ‚ö†Ô∏è | ‚úÖ |
| Verification | ‚ö†Ô∏è | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Modern UI | ‚ö†Ô∏è | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |

## üé¨ Demo Script Template

```
[OPEN ON HOMEPAGE]

"Hi! I'm [Name] and this is VoucherFinder. 

[PROBLEM]
We've all been there - you're about to checkout online, and you spend 15 minutes 
hunting for a discount code. Most codes you find are expired, and tools like Honey 
don't even credit the creators who shared them.

[SOLUTION]
VoucherFinder solves this in two ways:

First, we scrape codes from multiple sources including YouTube - which nobody else does.
Second, our AI suggests alternative strategies like free trials and student discounts 
that traditional tools completely miss.

[DEMO]
Let me show you. I'll search for Amazon Prime...

[TYPE AND SEARCH]

Look at this - within seconds, we have:
1. AI suggestions showing how to get a free trial and student discount
2. Working discount codes from YouTube creators and coupon sites
3. Everything is verified by our community

[CLICK COPY]

One click to copy. We also track which codes work best.

[CLICK VERIFY ON AI SUGGESTION]

Users can verify AI suggestions, building confidence scores.

[SEARCH NORDVPN]

Let's try NordVPN... See, completely different suggestions. AI knows Black Friday 
deals are better for VPNs, and shows you exactly how much you'd save.

[CLOSING]
So that's VoucherFinder - faster than Honey, smarter than RetailMeNot, and 
actually ethical. We're going after the $2.2B coupon market with a product 
that users and creators both love.

Thank you!"
```

## üìä Backup Talking Points (if things break)

- Walk through README
- Show code snippets

## üèÜ Winning Points

1. **Solves real problem** - Everyone has experienced bad discount code experiences
2. **Technical innovation** - Multi-source + AI is novel
3. **Market validation** - $4B Honey acquisition proves market exists
4. **Ethical angle** - Credits creators (good PR story)
5. **Beautiful execution** - Professional-looking MVP in 7 hours
