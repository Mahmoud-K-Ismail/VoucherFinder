# üéØ VoucherFinder - Hackathon Pitch

## Q&A Preparation

### Q: "What if Honey copies your AI feature?"
A: "First-mover advantage + ethical positioning + creator partnerships. Plus, our AI model learns from community verification, creating a data moat."

### Q: "How do you prevent code abuse?"
A: "Rate limiting, CAPTCHA for suspicious activity, and tracking code effectiveness to remove fake ones."

### Q: "Why not just use Honey?"
A: "Honey: 1) Doesn't scrape YouTube, 2) No AI suggestions, 3) Doesn't credit creators, 4) Missed 50%+ of codes in our tests."

### Q: "What about API costs?"
A: "YouTube is free (10k/day). OpenAI costs ~$0.03/suggestion. We cache for 7 days. At 10k users = $30/day = $900/month. Break-even at $300 affiliate revenue/month (easy)."

### Q: "How do you verify codes actually work?"
A: "Community voting + ML model learning from copy rates + (future) automated testing with Selenium."

### Q: "Can brands game your system?"
A: "No incentive‚Äîwe show all codes from all sources. Brands would need to spam every platform we scrape."
